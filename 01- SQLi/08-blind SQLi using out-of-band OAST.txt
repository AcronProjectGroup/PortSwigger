Exploiting blind SQL injection using out-of-band (OAST) techniques:

the application's response doesn't depend on whether the query returns any data, 
or on whether a database error occurs, 
or on the time taken to execute the query. 
it is often possible to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability 
by triggering out-of-band network interactions to a system that you control.

A variety of network protocols can be used for this purpose, 
but typically the most effective is DNS (domain name service). 
This is because very many production networks allow free egress of DNS queries, 
because they are essential for the normal operation of production systems.
