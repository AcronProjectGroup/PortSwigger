        Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query
            Solution
            1- Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.

            2- Modify the category parameter, giving it the value '+UNION+SELECT+NULL--. Observe that an error occurs.

            3- Modify the category parameter to add an additional column containing a null value:
                
                '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--
            
            4- Continue adding null values until the error disappears and the response includes additional content containing the null values.

        Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text
            Solution
            1- Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.

            2- Determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query. 
            Verify that the query is returning three columns, using the following payload in the category parameter:
                '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL--

            3- Try replacing each null with the random value provided by the lab, for example:
                
                '+UNION+SELECT+'pvheib',NULL,NULL--

                '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'GnzPjV',NULL--

                '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,'GnzPjV'--

            4- If an error occurs, move on to the next null and try that instead.
