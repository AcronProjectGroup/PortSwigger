  the conference presentation Server-Side Template Injection: 
  RCE for the Modern Web App.

* In this section, we'll discuss what server-side template injection 
  is and outline the basic methodology for exploiting server-side 
  template injection vulnerabilities. 
  We'll also suggest ways of making sure that your own 
  use of templates doesn't expose you to server-side template injection.
