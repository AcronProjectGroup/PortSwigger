Vulnerabilities in other authentication mechanisms:

    * change their password or reset their password when they forget it
      where an attacker is able to create their own account 
      and, consequently, has easy access to study these additional pages. 

Keeping users logged in

    * stay logged in even after closing a browser session
      a simple checkbox labeled something like 
      "Remember me" or "Keep me logged in"
      often implemented by generating a "remember me" token + stored in a persistent cookie.

    some websites generate this cookie based on:
     * a predictable concatenation of static values, such as the username and a timestamp.
         پیوستگی قابل پیش بینی

     * use the password as part of the cookie.
       Result = This approach is dangerous = attacker > username=mynameisx password=abcdefg123123&% + base64 or another way MD5 etc

     * the cookie is encrypted in some way it will not be guessable
       - Base64 offers no protection whatsoever.
       - encryption with a one-way hash function is not completely bulletproof. 
       Result =  if a similar limit isn't applied to cookie guesses. => dont limit Brute Force
