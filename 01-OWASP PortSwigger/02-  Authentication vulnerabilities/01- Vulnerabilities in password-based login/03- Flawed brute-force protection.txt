    Flawed brute-force protection:
    محافظت ناقص بروت فورس

    The two most common ways of preventing brute-force attacks are:
    * Locking the account that the remote user is trying to access 
      if they make too many failed login attempts
    * Blocking the remote user's IP address if they make too many 
      login attempts in quick succession
    Result:
    Both approaches offer varying degrees of protection, 
    but neither is invulnerable, especially if implemented using flawed logic. 

you can reset the counter for the number of failed login attempts 
by logging in to your own account before this limit is reached.

method:

    Packet-Number   counter-Blocker   user and pass 
    ------------    ---------------   -----------------
         1              0             valid user + pass 
         2              1             victim user + pass1?
         3              0             valid user + pass 
         4              1             victim user + pass2?
         5              0             valid user + pass 


Step1: Burp + Foxy 

Step2: Create a pitchfork attack + payload positions -> username and password parameters.

Step3: Resource pool tab -> Maximum concurrent requests = 1

Step4: Payloads tab ->  payload 1 -> 
    Your username is first and that carlos is repeated at least 100 times. 

Step5:  یک در میون! ارسال میکنیم

    Packet1 = True
    Packet2 = ?
    Packet3 = True
    Packet4 = ?
