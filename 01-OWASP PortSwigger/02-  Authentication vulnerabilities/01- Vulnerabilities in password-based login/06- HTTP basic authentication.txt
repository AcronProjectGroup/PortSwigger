Although fairly old




the client receives an authentication token from the server, 
which is constructed by concatenating the username and password, 
and encoding it in Base64. 

This token is stored and managed by the browser, 
which automatically adds 
it to the Authorization header of every subsequent request as follows: 

    Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)

    Firstly, 
    it involves repeatedly sending the user's login credentials with every request. 
    the website also implements HSTS, 
    user credentials are open to being captured in a man-in-the-middle attack. 

2-
    don't support brute-force protection. 


3- 
    vulnerable to session-related exploits
