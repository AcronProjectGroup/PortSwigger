Blind SQL injection:

    In this section, we'll describe what blind SQL injection is, 
    explain various techniques for finding and exploiting blind SQL injection vulnerabilities. 

    1- conditional responses:
        1-1- Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering conditional responses

    2- Error-based SQL injection:
        2-1- Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering conditional errors
        2-2- Extracting sensitive data via verbose SQL error messages
    
    3- Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering time delays


    4- Exploiting blind SQL injection using out-of-band (OAST) techniques
