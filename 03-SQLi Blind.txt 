    What is blind SQL injection? 
        Blind SQL injection arises when an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, 
        but its HTTP responses do not contain the results of the relevant SQL query or 
        the details of any database errors. 
        many techniques such as UNION attacks, are not effective because 
        they rely on being able 
        to see the results of the injected query within the application's responses.
    In this section, we'll describe what blind SQL injection is, 
    explain various techniques for finding and exploiting blind SQL injection vulnerabilities. 

    1- conditional responses:
        1-1- Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering conditional responses

    2- Error-based SQL injection:

        2-2- Extracting sensitive data via verbose SQL error messages

    3- Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering time delays


    4- Exploiting blind SQL injection using out-of-band (OAST) techniques
