Brute-force attacks:
    * Automating this process, especially using dedicated tools
    * attackers can fine-tune brute-force attacks to make much more educated guesses.
    * Websites that rely on password-based login as their sole method of authenticating users 
      if they do not implement sufficient brute-force protection,
      can be highly vulnerable. 

Brute-forcing usernames:
    * However, even if there is no obvious pattern, 
      sometimes even high-privileged accounts are created using predictable usernames, 
      such as "admin" or "administrator". 

    * You should also check HTTP responses to see if any email addresses are disclosed. 
      Occasionally, responses contain emails addresses of high-privileged users 
      like administrators and IT support.

Brute-forcing passwords:
    * Many websites adopt some form of password policy:
        - A minimum number of characters
        - A mixture of lower and uppercase letters
        - At least one special character !@#$^@!#$@%!
    
    * Rather than creating a strong password with a random combination of characters, 
      users often take a password that they can remember and try to crowbar 
      it into fitting the password policy.
        - mypassword
        - Mypassword1?
        - Mypassword2!
        - MypassworD123!@#


Username enumeration:
    * Username enumeration is when an attacker is able to observe changes in 
      the website's behavior in order to identify whether a given username is valid. 

    * typically occurs either on the login page.

    * in Brute-Forcing you should pay particular attention to any differences in:
        - Status codes: 200 = OK -- 302 Redirect
            If a guess returns a different status code, this is a strong indication that the username was correct.
            but this practice is not always followed. 

        - Error messages:
            Sometimes the returned error message is different depending on whether both the username AND password 
            are incorrect or only the password was incorrect.

        - Response times:
            If most of the requests were handled with a similar response time, 
            any that deviate from this suggest that something different was happening behind the scenes. 

            Example:  True username + Loooooong PAsswooooord ! = Delay to processing Server side

information:
* It has an account with a predictable username and password.

Step 1: Burp + FoxyProxy

Step 2: Get Packet > Proxy > HTTP history > POST /login > send it to Burp Intruder

Step 3: Sniper attack type is selected

Step 4: Payloads > Simple list payload type is selected

Step 5: Payload settings, paste the list of candidate usernames

Step 6: click Start attack

Step 7: Results > examine the Length column? > sort the results
        Notice that other responses contain the message Invalid username, but this response says Incorrect password.

Step 8: Get username > Save it some where

Step 9: go back to the Positions tab > Clear > Add a payload position to the password parameter
    username=identified-user&password=§invalid-password§

Step 10: Payloads> clear the list of usernames and replace it with the list of candidate passwords
