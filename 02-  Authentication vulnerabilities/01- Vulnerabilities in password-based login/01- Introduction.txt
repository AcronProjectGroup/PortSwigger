What is authentication?
    is the process of verifying the identity of a given user or client.
    OR 
    it involves making sure that they really are who they claim to be.

three authentication factors categorized:
    1- Something you know ----------------> password / answer to a security question
    2- Something you have ----------------> physical object mobile / security token
    3- Something you are or do -----------> your biometrics or patterns of behavior


What is the difference between authentication and authorization? تفاوت احراز هویت با مجوز
    1- Authentication is the process of verifying that a user really is who they claim to be
    for example login
    2- authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something. 
    for example read a data


How do authentication vulnerabilities arise?
    two ways:
    1- The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks. 
    2- Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes referred to as "broken authentication". 


What is the impact of vulnerable authentication?
    * access to all the data and functionality that the compromised Victim account has.
    * If they are able to compromise a high-privileged account, such as a system administrator, 
      they could take full control over the entire application and potentially gain access to internal infrastructure. 


Vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms
    * Vulnerabilities in password-based login 
    * Vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication 
    * Vulnerabilities in other authentication mechanisms
