Resetting user passwords:

    * it is a given that some users will forget their password.

    * the password reset functionality is inherently dangerous 
      and needs to be implemented securely. 



Sending passwords by email:

* some websites generate a new password and send this to the user via email.

* this approach is highly susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. 


Resetting passwords using a URL:

* A more robust method

* Less secure implementations of this method use a URL 
  with an easily guessable parameter to identify which 
  account is being reset, for example:
  http://vulnerable-website.com/reset-password?user=victim-user
  Result > 
  an attacker could change the user parameter to refer to any username they have identified.

* A better implementation of this process 
  > hard-to-guess token and create the reset URL based on that.
  http://vulnerable-website.com/reset-password?token=a0ba0d1cb3b63d13822572fcff1a241895d893f659164d4cc550b421ebdd48a8


* When the user visits this URL, the system should check whether 
  this token exists on the back-end and, if so, which user's password
  it is supposed to reset. This token should expire after a short period of time 
  and be destroyed immediately after the password has been reset.


* However, some websites fail to also validate the token again when 
  the reset form is submitted. In this case, an attacker could simply visit 
  the reset form from their own account, delete the token, 
  and leverage this page to reset an arbitrary user's password.

* If the URL in the reset email is generated dynamically, 
  this may also be vulnerable to password reset poisoning. 
  In this case, an attacker can potentially steal 
  another user's token and use it change their password.
