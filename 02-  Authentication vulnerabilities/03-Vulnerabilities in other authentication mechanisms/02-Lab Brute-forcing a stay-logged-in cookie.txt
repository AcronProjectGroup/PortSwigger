Step1: Burp + FoxyProxy

Step2: login with "wiener:peter" + Stay logged in 
        > Notice stay-logged-in cookie. 

Step3: Examine this cookie in the Inspector panel.
       wiener:51dc30ddc473d43a6011e9ebba6ca770

       Result:
       you can make an educated guess that this may be a hash of your password.
       username:password

Step4: Hash your password using MD5.
       Search in Google: hash MD5 online
       https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/

      MD5(peter) = 51dc30ddc473d43a6011e9ebba6ca770
      
Result of web application => d2llbmVyOjUxZGMzMGRkYzQ3M2Q0M2E2MDExZTllYmJhNmNhNzcw

My recon:
       base64(wiener:51dc30ddc473d43a6011e9ebba6ca770) =>  d2llbmVyOjUxZGMzMGRkYzQ3M2Q0M2E2MDExZTllYmJhNmNhNzcw

Result > confirm that this is the case.
       > base64(username+':'+md5HashOfPassword)

Step5: Log out of your account. 

Step6: > recent (GET /my-account) Packet 
       > highlight the stay-logged-in cookie parameter 
       > Send to Burp Intruder

       Result >
       the stay-logged-in cookie has been automatically added as a payload position.  

Step7: Add your own password as a single payload.

Step8: > Under Payload processing
       > add the following rules in order
       
       Result >
       will be applied sequentially 
       to each payload before the request is submitted.
       Hash: MD5
       Add prefix: wiener:
       Encode: Base64-encode

* As the Update email button 
  is only displayed when you access the /my-account page

* use the presence or absence of this button 
  to determine whether we've successfully brute-forced the cookie.

Step9: > Settings tab 
       > add a grep match rule to flag any responses containing the string Update email.
       
Step10: Start attack

    Result > Notice that the generated payload was used to successfully load your own account page.
           > confirms that the payload processing rules work as expected
           > you were able to construct a valid cookie for your own account.
        
Step11: Remove your own password from the payload list

Step12: add the list of candidate passwords instead.

Step13: Change the Add prefix rule to add carlos: instead of wiener:

Step14: Start attack

        Result > When the attack is finished the lab will be solved.
    

* Notice that only one request returned a response containing Update email.
* The payload from this request is the valid stay-logged-in cookie for Carlos's account.
