* Even if the attacker is not able to create their own account

* such as XSS, an attacker could steal another user's "remember me"

* Information lab:
    Your credentials: wiener:peter
    Victim's username: carlos

* Learning path:
    If you're following our suggested learning path, 
    please note that this lab requires some 
    understanding of topics that we haven't covered yet. 
    Don't worry if you get stuck; 
    try coming back later once you've developed your knowledge further.
